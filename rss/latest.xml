      <title>Hierarchical Federated Learning with Multi-Timescale Gradient Correction</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/hierarchical-federated-learning-with-multi</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Our key idea is to introduce distinct control variables to (i) correct the client gradient towards the group gradient, i. e., to reduce client model drift caused by local updates based on individual datasets, and (ii) correct the group gradient towards the global gradient, i. e., to reduce group model drift caused by FL over clients within the group.]]></description>

      <title>Let the Quantum Creep In: Designing Quantum Neural Network Models by Gradually Swapping Out Classical Components</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/let-the-quantum-creep-in-designing-quantum</link>
      <description><![CDATA[To provide a more fine-grained characterisation of the impact of quantum components on the performance of neural networks, we propose a framework where classical neural network layers are gradually replaced by quantum layers that have the same type of input and output while keeping the flow of information between layers unchanged, different from most current research in quantum neural network, which favours an end-to-end quantum model.]]></description>

      <title>DMC-VB: A Benchmark for Representation Learning for Control with Visual Distractors</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/dmc-vb-a-benchmark-for-representation</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we present theDeepMind Control Visual Benchmark (DMC-VB), a dataset collected in the DeepMind Control Suite to evaluate the robustness of offline RL agents for solving continuous control tasks from visual input in the presence of visual distractors.]]></description>
