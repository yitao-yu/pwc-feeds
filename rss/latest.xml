      <title>Robustness Evaluation in Hand Pose Estimation Models using Metamorphic Testing</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/robustness-evaluation-in-hand-pose-estimation</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We found that on average more than 80\% of the hands could not be identified by BodyHands, and at least 50\% of hands could not be identified by MediaPipe hands when diagonal motion blur is introduced, while an average of more than 50\% of strongly underexposed hands could not be correctly estimated by NSRM hand.]]></description>
