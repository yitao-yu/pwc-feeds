      <title>Exploring Annotation-free Image Captioning with Retrieval-augmented Pseudo Sentence Generation</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/exploring-annotation-free-image-captioning</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We further show that with a simple extension, the generated pseudo sentences can be deployed as weak supervision to boost the 1% semi-supervised image caption benchmark up to 93. 4 CIDEr score (+8. 9) which showcases the versatility and effectiveness of our approach.]]></description>

      <title>Creative Birds: Self-Supervised Single-View 3D Style Transfer</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/creative-birds-self-supervised-single-view-3d</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Our focus lies primarily on birds, a popular subject in 3D reconstruction, for which no existing single-view 3D transfer methods have been developed. The method we propose seeks to generate a 3D mesh shape and texture of a bird from two single-view images.]]></description>
