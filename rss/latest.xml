      <title>The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/the-impact-of-positional-encoding-on-length</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE).]]></description>
