      <description><![CDATA[In this paper, to unveil interpretable development-specific gene signatures in human PFC, we propose a novel gene selection method, named Interpretable Causality Gene Selection (ICGS), which adopts a Bayesian Network (BN) to represent causality between multiple gene variables and a development variable.]]></description>
