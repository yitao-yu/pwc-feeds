      <title>Monitoring machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction algorithms in the presence of confounding medical interventions</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/monitoring-machine-learning-ml-based-risk</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Monitoring the performance of machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction models in healthcare is complicated by the issue of confounding medical interventions (CMI): when an algorithm predicts a patient to be at high risk for an adverse event, clinicians are more likely to administer prophylactic treatment and alter the very target that the algorithm aims to predict.]]></description>

      <title>Towards Good Practices in Evaluating Transfer Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/towards-good-practices-in-evaluating-transfer</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Our evaluation reveals new important insights: 1) Transferability is highly contextual, and some white-box defenses may give a false sense of security since they are actually vulnerable to (black-box) transfer attacks; 2) All transfer attacks are less stealthy, and their stealthiness can vary dramatically under the same $L_{\infty}$ bound.]]></description>
