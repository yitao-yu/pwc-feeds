      <description><![CDATA[In this work, (1) we propose a novel three-decoder architecture as the infrastructure for focused attention; 2) we use the generalized intersection box prediction task to effectively guide our model to focus on occlusion-specific regions; 3) our model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on distance-aware relationship detection.]]></description>

      <title>Multi-domain Learning for Updating Face Anti-spoofing Models</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/multi-domain-learning-for-updating-face-anti</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this work, we study multi-domain learning for face anti-spoofing(MD-FAS), where a pre-trained FAS model needs to be updated to perform equally well on both source and target domains while only using target domain data for updating.]]></description>
