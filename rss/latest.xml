      <title>Self-Supervised Contrastive BERT Fine-tuning for Fusion-based Reviewed-Item Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/self-supervised-contrastive-bert-fine-tuning</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Experimental results show that Late Fusion contrastive learning for Neural RIR outperforms all other contrastive IR configurations, Neural IR, and sparse retrieval baselines, thus demonstrating the power of exploiting the two-level structure in Neural RIR approaches as well as the importance of preserving the nuance of individual review content via Late Fusion methods.]]></description>
