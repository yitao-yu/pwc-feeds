      <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a simple method named Ensemble Projectors Aided for Semi-supervised Learning (EPASS), which focuses mainly on improving the learned embeddings to boost the performance of the existing contrastive joint-training semi-supervised learning frameworks.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Previous approaches for automatic lay summarisation are exclusively reliant on the source article that, given it is written for a technical audience (e. g., researchers), is unlikely to explicitly define all technical concepts or state all of the background information that is relevant for a lay audience.]]></description>
