      <title>Reliability Assurance for Deep Neural Network Architectures Against Numerical Defects</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/reliability-assurance-for-deep-neural-network</link>
      <description><![CDATA[To assure high reliability against numerical defects, in this paper, we propose the RANUM approach including novel techniques for three reliability assurance tasks: detection of potential numerical defects, confirmation of potential-defect feasibility, and suggestion of defect fixes.]]></description>
