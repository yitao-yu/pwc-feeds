      <title>Large-Scale Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning on Grids with Path Deconfliction</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/large-scale-multi-robot-coverage-path-1</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We study Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) on a 4-neighbor 2D grid G, which aims to compute paths for multiple robots to cover all cells of G. Traditional approaches are limited as they first compute coverage trees on a quadrant coarsened grid H and then employ the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) paradigm to generate paths on G, making them inapplicable to grids with partially obstructed 2x2 blocks.]]></description>
