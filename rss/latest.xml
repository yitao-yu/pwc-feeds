      <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the intrinsic effectiveness of recent approaches and make three key observations: 1) linear mapping is critical to prior long-term time series forecasting efforts; 2) RevIN (reversible normalization) and CI (Channel Independent) play a vital role in improving overall forecasting performance; and 3) linear mapping can effectively capture periodic features in time series and has robustness for different periods across channels when increasing the input horizon.]]></description>
