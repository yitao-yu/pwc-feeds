      <description><![CDATA[More specifically, by leveraging the concept of non-local operations and mapping the features obtained from the backbone network to the graph structure space, we propose a unified self-focus mechanism for bitemporal images. This approach enhances the information coupling between the two temporal images while effectively suppressing task-irrelevant interference, Based on a streamlined backbone architecture, namely ResNet18, our model demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods (SOTA) on the GZ CD dataset.]]></description>
