      <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we show that model FI supervision can meaningfully improve VQA model accuracy as well as performance on several Right-for-the-Right-Reason (RRR) metrics by optimizing for four key model objectives: (1) accurate predictions given limited but sufficient information (Sufficiency); (2) max-entropy predictions given no important information (Uncertainty); (3) invariance of predictions to changes in unimportant features (Invariance); and (4) alignment between model FI explanations and human FI explanations (Plausibility).]]></description>

      <title>KE-RCNN: Unifying Knowledge based Reasoning into Part-level Attribute Parsing</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/ke-rcnn-unifying-knowledge-based-reasoning</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this article, we propose a Knowledge Embedded RCNN (KE-RCNN) to identify attributes by leveraging rich knowledges, including implicit knowledge (e. g., the attribute ``above-the-hip'' for a shirt requires visual/geometry relations of shirt-hip) and explicit knowledge (e. g., the part of ``shorts'' cannot have the attribute of ``hoodie'' or ``lining'').]]></description>
