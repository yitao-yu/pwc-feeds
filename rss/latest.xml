      <title>Transformer-based Image Generation from Scene Graphs</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/transformer-based-image-generation-from-scene</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this work, we show how employing multi-head attention to encode the graph information, as well as using a transformer-based model in the latent space for image generation can improve the quality of the sampled data, without the need to employ adversarial models with the subsequent advantage in terms of training stability.]]></description>
