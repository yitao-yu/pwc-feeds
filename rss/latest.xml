      <description><![CDATA[Notwithstanding the promise of Lipschitz-based approaches to \emph{deterministically} train and certify robust deep networks, the state-of-the-art results only make successful use of feed-forward Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) on low-dimensional data, e. g. CIFAR-10.]]></description>
