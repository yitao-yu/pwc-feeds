      <title>ESTextSpotter: Towards Better Scene Text Spotting with Explicit Synergy in Transformer</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/estextspotter-towards-better-scene-text</link>
      <description><![CDATA[To this end, we introduce a new model named Explicit Synergy-based Text Spotting Transformer framework (ESTextSpotter), which achieves explicit synergy by modeling discriminative and interactive features for text detection and recognition within a single decoder.]]></description>
