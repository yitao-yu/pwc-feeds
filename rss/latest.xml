      <description><![CDATA[Our one-class classifier is calibrated in two ways: (1) by adaptively penalizing uncertain predictions, which helps eliminate the impact of anomaly contamination while accentuating the predictions that the one-class model is confident in, and (2) by discriminating the normal samples from native anomaly examples that are generated to simulate genuine time series abnormal behaviors on the basis of original data.]]></description>
