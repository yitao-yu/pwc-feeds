Despite the meaningful semantics generation, the existing arts suffer from the semantic discrepancy between masked and unmasked regions, since the semantically dense unmasked texture fails to be completely degraded while the masked regions turn to the pure noise in diffusion process, leading to the large discrepancy between them.]]></description>
