      <title>A Simulation Benchmark for Autonomous Racing with Large-Scale Human Data</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/a-simulation-benchmark-for-autonomous-racing</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Despite the availability of international prize-money competitions, scaled vehicles, and simulation environments, research on autonomous racing and the control of sports cars operating close to the limit of handling has been limited by the high costs of vehicle acquisition and management, as well as the limited physics accuracy of open-source simulators.]]></description>
