      <title>Self-regulating Prompts: Foundational Model Adaptation without Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/self-regulating-prompts-foundational-model</link>
      <description><![CDATA[To the best of our knowledge, this is the first regularization framework for prompt learning that avoids overfitting by jointly attending to pre-trained model features, the training trajectory during prompting, and the textual diversity.]]></description>

      <title>Implicit regularization in AI meets generalized hardness of approximation in optimization -- Sharp results for diagonal linear networks</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/implicit-regularization-in-ai-meets</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this work we provide sharp results for the implicit regularization imposed by the gradient flow of Diagonal Linear Networks (DLNs) in the over-parameterized regression setting and, potentially surprisingly, link this to the phenomenon of phase transitions in generalized hardness of approximation (GHA).]]></description>
