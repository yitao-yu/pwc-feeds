      <title>A Multi-Stage Automated Online Network Data Stream Analytics Framework for IIoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/a-multi-stage-automated-online-network-data</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Stage Automated Network Analytics (MSANA) framework for concept drift adaptation in IIoT systems, consisting of dynamic data pre-processing, the proposed Drift-based Dynamic Feature Selection (DD-FS) method, dynamic model learning & selection, and the proposed Window-based Performance Weighted Probability Averaging Ensemble (W-PWPAE) model.]]></description>
