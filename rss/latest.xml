      <description><![CDATA[Considering two decision-making tasks $A$ and $B$, each of which wishes to compute an effective \textit{decision} $Y$ for a given \textit{query} $X$, {can we solve task $B$ by using query-decision pairs $(X, Y)$ of $A$ without knowing the latent decision-making model?}]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[For the more typical applications of FL where the number of clients is large (e. g., edge-device and mobile applications), these methods cannot be applied, motivating the need for a stateless approach to heterogeneous FL which can be used for any number of clients.]]></description>
