      <title>DYMOND: DYnamic MOtif-NoDes Network Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/dymond-dynamic-motif-nodes-network-generative</link>
      <description><![CDATA[To address these issues, in this work we propose DYnamic MOtif-NoDes (DYMOND) -- a generative model that considers (i) the dynamic changes in overall graph structure using temporal motif activity and (ii) the roles nodes play in motifs (e. g., one node plays the hub role in a wedge, while the remaining two act as spokes).]]></description>
