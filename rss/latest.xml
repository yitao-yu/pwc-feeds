      <title>PIXELS: Progressive Image Xemplar-based Editing with Latent Surgery</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/pixels-progressive-image-xemplar-based</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for progressive exemplar-driven editing with off-the-shelf diffusion models, dubbed PIXELS, to enable customization by providing granular control over edits, allowing adjustments at the pixel or region level.]]></description>
