      <description><![CDATA[We first explore the feasibility of a system that places an LLM at the center of command inference and action planning, showing that LLMs have the capacity to infer intent behind vague, context-dependent commands like "get ready for a party" and respond with concrete, machine-parseable instructions that can be used to control smart devices.]]></description>

      <title>Towards Making the Most of ChatGPT for Machine Translation</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/towards-making-the-most-of-chatgpt-for</link>
      <description><![CDATA[We show that: 1) The performance of ChatGPT depends largely on temperature, and a lower temperature usually can achieve better performance; 2) Emphasizing the task information further improves ChatGPT's performance, particularly in complex MT tasks; 3) Introducing domain information can elicit ChatGPT's generalization ability and improve its performance in the specific domain; 4) ChatGPT tends to generate hallucinations for non-English-centric MT tasks, which can be partially addressed by our proposed prompts but still need to be highlighted for the MT/NLP community.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[As it is hard to calibrate single-view RGB images in the wild, existing 3D human mesh reconstruction (3DHMR) methods either use a constant large focal length or estimate one based on the background environment context, which can not tackle the problem of the torso, limb, hand or face distortion caused by perspective camera projection when the camera is close to the human body.]]></description>
