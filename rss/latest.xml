      <title>DeltaSpace: A Semantic-aligned Feature Space for Flexible Text-guided Image Editing</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/deltaspace-a-semantic-aligned-feature-space</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Based on DeltaSpace, we propose a novel framework called DeltaEdit, which maps the CLIP visual feature differences to the latent space directions of a generative model during the training phase, and predicts the latent space directions from the CLIP textual feature differences during the inference phase.]]></description>
