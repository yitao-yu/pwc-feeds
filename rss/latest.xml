      <title>Implicit Obstacle Map-driven Indoor Navigation Model for Robust Obstacle Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/implicit-obstacle-map-driven-indoor</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Robust obstacle avoidance is one of the critical steps for successful goal-driven indoor navigation tasks. Due to the obstacle missing in the visual image and the possible missed detection issue, visual image-based obstacle avoidance techniques still suffer from unsatisfactory robustness.]]></description>
