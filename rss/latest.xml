      <title>DiffusionNER: Boundary Diffusion for Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/diffusionner-boundary-diffusion-for-named</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In this paper, we propose DiffusionNER, which formulates the named entity recognition task as a boundary-denoising diffusion process and thus generates named entities from noisy spans.]]></description>
