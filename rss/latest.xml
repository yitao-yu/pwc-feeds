      <title>Scalable Incomplete Multi-View Clustering with Structure Alignment</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/scalable-incomplete-multi-view-clustering</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Although several anchor-based IMVC methods have been proposed to process the large-scale incomplete data, they still suffer from the following drawbacks: i) Most existing approaches neglect the inter-view discrepancy and enforce cross-view representation to be consistent, which would corrupt the representation capability of the model; ii) Due to the samples disparity between different views, the learned anchor might be misaligned, which we referred as the Anchor-Unaligned Problem for Incomplete data (AUP-ID).]]></description>
