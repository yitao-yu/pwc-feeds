      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/muse-text-to-image-generation-via-masked</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Compared to pixel-space diffusion models, such as Imagen and DALL-E 2, Muse is significantly more efficient due to the use of discrete tokens and requiring fewer sampling iterations; compared to autoregressive models, such as Parti, Muse is more efficient due to the use of parallel decoding.]]></description>

      <title>Credible Remote Sensing Scene Classification Using Evidential Fusion on Aerial-Ground Dual-view Images</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/credible-remote-sensing-scene-classification</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Based on this uncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that the view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more credible.]]></description>
