      <title>Self-supervised Matting-specific Portrait Enhancement and Generation</title>
      <link>https://paperswithcode.com/paper/self-supervised-matting-specific-portrait</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Particularly, we invert an input portrait into the latent code of StyleGAN, and our aim is to discover whether there is an enhanced version in the latent space which is more compatible with a reference matting model.]]></description>
