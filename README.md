I host my feed and scripts to generate them at [My repo](https://github.com/yitao-yu/pwc-feeds).

The original rss feed is not available in my region. I simply addapt the code and created a similar service utilizing the github action. 

This version doesn't support the deployment described in the original repo. 

This is **NOT** an official *paperswithcode* rss feed.
